# Gerrymandering
A monte-carlo simulation meant to maximise gerrymandering, based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lq-Y7crQo44).
Currently the project is very crude and barely a prototype, but in the future I want it to be able to actually gerrymander.

## Current state
Right now the program just takes into account the equality of population between 'states' and their perimeter over area.
It currently fails at keeping 'states' as continous blobs, frequently breaking it's border. It's also just really slow.
